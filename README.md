## 01 Summary

I attempted to create a javascript quiz with a countdown timer that logs the time remaining to local storage. I have so far had great difficulty with this project but I will be returning and resubmitting this project when I have a final solution.

## 02 Timer

The timer is functioning, and counts down from 60. The quiz ends when the timer runs out or when you answer the final question.

## 03 Questions

The questions cycle when the correct answer is selected and your score increases by one.
