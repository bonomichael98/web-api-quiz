## 01 Summary

I attempted to create a javascript quiz with a countdown timer that logs the time remaining to local storage. I have so far had great difficulty with this project but I will be returning and resubmitting this project when I have a final solution.

## 02 Timer

The timer is functioning, however when the quiz is finished there isn't currently a system to store the score.

## 03 Questions

The questions do have a method to cycle through to the next question, although I was unable to add a system to check for a correct answer.
